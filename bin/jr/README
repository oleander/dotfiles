This is the JR programming language from the University of California, Davis.

Information about JR is available from
http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~olsson/research/jr.

We thank the SR Project at The University of Arizona
(http://www.cs.arizona.edu/sr/), from which we borrowed ideas, words,
and code.

The JR system is in the public domain and you may use and distribute
it as you wish.  We ask that you retain credits referencing the
University of California, Davis and that you identify any changes you
make.

We can't provide a warranty with JR; it's up to you to determine its
suitability and reliability for your needs.  We do intend to continue
to develop and maintain JR as resources permit, and would like to hear
of any problems.
