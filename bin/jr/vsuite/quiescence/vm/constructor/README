Subject: Re: bug with quiescence?

	The bug arose because a constructor on a non-local virtual
machine used operations.  The quiescence bookkeeping in the old code
did not account for such because it did not count a constructor call
(to create a remote instance) as a thread birth with a subsequent death
after the constructor terminated.  Doing so fixes the problem.  I'm
currently running the vsuite and everything passes (except the
preprocessors, which I haven't properly configured).
