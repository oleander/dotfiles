SR programs equivalent to the JR progams in 1 and 2
give same output.

JR differs in how it selects invocations:
it picks oldest invocation first, and then applies st.

SR does it in opposite order.

JR's approach is easier to implement, especially when operation is
located remotely.

Probably won't make much of a difference, except in contrived
programs.
