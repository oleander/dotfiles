01 - basic
02 - 01 but w/ done op at class level (rather than local) -- shouldn't compile
03 - 02 but w/ static

04+05+06 --- weren't interesting enough; subsumed by other tests

07 - 06 w/ inheritance to get PrefServer
08 - 07 w/ protected start in PrefServer
09 - 08 w/ protected start in Server

10 - 09 w/ st in instmt

21 - 01, but uses instmt with st rather than ifs and instmts
     (when 01 was written, st wasn't yet functional;
      01 remains a good test.)

**** note that 08 and 09 create 2 servers (inheritance anomaly).
**** perhaps those tests should be simplified and moved elsewhere
**** since they're not R/W in traditional sense.
**** (their behavior is also quite non-deterministic.)
