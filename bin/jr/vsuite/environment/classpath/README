these tests have dependencies:

  mypkg/Script creates mypkg.jar
  testcode[a-y]* programs use it
  testcodezend/Script removes it

assumptions:

  directory naming: jrv executes these tests in alphabetic order.

  the name mypkg is hardcoded into some of the Scripts, so update all
  Scripts if you rename it.
