	intermittent problem with

           ex_in_ppc/cocall/05/
           ex_in_ppc/cosend


	when run with jrv, sometimes would drop lines or parts of
	lines, e.g.,
	
	instead of   

            Oops.  The JR world isn't so wonderful ;-(

	might get just

             ;-(

	and, other times, this line would disappear

	   received GO: 2

	(confirmed in separate tests (using counter) that the inni was actually
	executing, but that output was lost)

	when run by hand, never saw the problem.

	I suspect problem has something to do with redirecting both
	stdout and stderr to same file with jrv Script, but I don't
	know for sure.  (And that program actually outputs to both
	stdout and stderr, probably at the same time; doesn't seem to
	be a problem when program outputs to just stdout.)

	So, I changed the Script to redirect to 2 files, and all seems
	well.  Normally, would see problem within 20 runs of

           $jr/jrv/ruf -c -- $jr/jrv/jrv -d . -s

	Now, haven't seen it in 5000 runs.

	I also made changes in all Scripts for other tests in this
	directory.  This problem might arise in similar situations, so
	be careful.
