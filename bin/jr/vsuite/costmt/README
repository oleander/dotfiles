2006-08-02 note that some of these tests depend on our implementation
           of co stmt:

    -- that replies to co invocations (from same VM) get queued up for
       handling by ppc in order that they're generated (and are indeed
       handled in that order).

    -- that co-send PPCs are executed in lexical order (top->bottom)
