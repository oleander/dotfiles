These tests are useful to test most fundamental things for JR and jrv
to work.

Right now, they include tests of Java and jrv.

(2005-07-11 Java is included to help make sure CLASSPATH is not set to
something bogus, e.g., using ":" rather than ";" as separator in
Windows.  Better to find out early with this test than to find out
later when run multi-VM programs.  Perhaps this should be in vm/, but
it's here since it also contains basic Java test and should be run early.)

named so will be first alphabetically in vsuite to ensure that these things
work before trying other tests...
