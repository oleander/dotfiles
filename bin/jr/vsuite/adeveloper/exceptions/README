2007-01-25 RAO added these tests of exceptions for revamping of
           exception handling (2.00003)

           note that capThrows tests don't get used;
           they might be useful in future as tests
           for checking that caps throw what they get assigned
           e.g., cap c = o;
           c and o throw exactly same (or c throws superset)
