One could argue that this shouldn't be legal based on the book's:

   Given that a remote reference
   is really a collection of individual operation capabilities,
   non-static variables and methods are *not* accessible
   via a remote reference to the object.

I.e., the above print implicitly invokes c's toString method.
Although what's really happening in the above is that it's invoking
the toString method in c's local JRC proxy object.

Choices:

(1) actually invoke the toString method in the remote object.  That
    would be hard to implement and inconsistent with the above rule.

(2) leave it as is, but note it somewhere as a slight inconsistency
    (on the webpage as an implementation deficiency, I suppose).

(3) throw a run-time error.
