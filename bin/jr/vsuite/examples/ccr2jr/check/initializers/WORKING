2003-08-15 now seems fine.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


So, should change tests 2 and 3 (uncomment) once attached is resolved.

and remove 2NW and 3NW
(those just test translation, not execution)

/home/olsson/bugjr/43 gives


Exception in thread "main" java.lang.VerifyError: (class: buffer, method: <init> signature: ()V) Accessing value from uninitialized register 2
	at i3.<clinit>(i3.java:50)

If I comment out either the V or the (decl and init of hoo), then it
works.  (/home/olsson/test/java/static1 seems to indicate what I'm
doing is legal Java.)  JR problem?

	Neither.  I believe this is another instantiation of a weird
Java problem that we saw before.  Unfortunately, there isn't an easy
measure of when it will happen though I believe it does have something
to do with the use of static initializers.  Here's a bug report (though
his code doesn't use static initializer, but says it does).

http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4210106.html

Here's Sun's response (in case you don't view the bug report):
"This bug is being closed because the new javac compiler does not exhibit
this behavior.  No work on the old javac compiler is planned.  The new
javac compiler is shipping with the 1.3 release of J2SE.  The old compiler
is provided in 1.3 for backwards compatibility; it will be withdrawn in a
future release of J2SE."

	I installed the most recent compiler for Linux that I could find
in September (1.2.2).  It looks like 1.3 is now available (including
a RedHat RPM) at:
http://www.javasoft.com/j2se/1.3/download-linux.html

	Hmm, I should probably upgrade avalon someday.  Anyhow, I'll
upgrade the Linux machines at some point (except pi) and check to see
if this is really fixed (for this code example).

FYI: This new version does not appear to be from Blackdown.  Perhaps
Sun has finally recognized that Linux isn't just a fad.

	I've installed the newest compiler on the CSIF machines in
my directory (boy I'm using a lot of their disk).  Anyhow, it works
under this version.

	I'm going to delete the old version to save some disk space.
