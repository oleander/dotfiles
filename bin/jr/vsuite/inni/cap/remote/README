  This is a problem that I have seen before but cannot solve.  I've
tracked it down (then and now) to a problem with the call to receive.
The recv method within the op actually locks the queue, removes the
invocation, unlocks the queue, and returns the value.  However, that
value never gets back to the process calling the receive.
