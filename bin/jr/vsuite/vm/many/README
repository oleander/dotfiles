2002-04-17 modified Script to use scmp rather than cmp.
           removed sleeps and flushes from .jr code,
           which were an attempt to get order correct, but weren't
           guaranteed to work (as discovered on a Windows system).
	   having to use scmp is a bit unfortunate (it defeats the
           purpose of some of the fancy code in main).

	This is because there is currently a different print thread
for each VM.  That thread simply reads a line and then prints that
line.  The scheduling of the threads is likely causing the different
orderings.
