  I believe that the problem might be due to the jvm on CSIF using
green threads.  At least, that's my best guess.  Even when I change
the seq string, the threads still print in order.  Unfortunately,
there is no way to yield to the print threads from the user JRVM's
because the print threads run within JRX.
