This test should pass

  on systems with statically assigned IP addresses

  on systems with dynamically assigned IP addresses (DHCP)

This test will fail in some configurations we've seen on systems with
  dynamically assigned IP addresses (DHCP)

  on a system that hasn't an IP address assigned whose networking is
  presently off.  JR should work fine, though.

  on a system where the hostname is on the 127.0.0.1 line in
  /etc/hosts.  We consider this configuration unusual, although JR
  should work fine with it.
