Remote static nested classes make sense for JR.  However, the
implementation does not presently work.  It wouldn't be too hard to
fix, I think.  The generated code has the class name, e.g., "Main.A"
instead of "Main$A".  Quick hand tests with that change seem to work
fine.  But, since no-one seems to have missed that feature, we're
leaving it as an implementation deficiency.

Remote inner classes (i.e., non-static) don't make sense in JR.
Consider creating a remote instance of an inner class.  Instances of
inner classes need to be associated with an instance of the enclosing
class. So, what is the enclosing instance in such a case?  The
implementation currently doesn't work, with same error as that in
static nested classes.  (If change the string by hand, get a different
run-time error.)  This should be a compile-time error, but we'll not
worry about it for now and leave it as an implementation deficiency.

decided not to test these (moved Scripts out of the way).  Seem to
give non-det exit status (0 or 1) and on some systems (my laptop
ibis), had problems with getting error output, as noted in
inner/main.jr.
