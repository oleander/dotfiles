jrv uses grep, sort, etc. defined in ../bin

note that some of those tools are just approximation of standard UNIX
tools (e.g., see note in grep.pl),
so be careful what you put in Script files.

It's best to run jrv with standard UNIX tools as a double check.
(just copy jrv, edit and use that copy.)
