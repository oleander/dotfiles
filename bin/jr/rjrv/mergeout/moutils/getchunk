#!/bin/bash

# assumes
# -- file is well-formed, i.e.,
#    -- has (only) two lines with DATE

## one attempt:
## this is OK, but also includes DATE lines
## sed -n -e '/^DATE/,/^DATE/ p'                                            

# first sed outputs all between the two DATE, including the DATE lines.
# second sed removes the DATE lines.
# probably a way to do this with a single sed command,
# but I'll leave that to the experts.
sed -n -e '/^DATE/,/^DATE/ p' | sed -e '/^DATE/d'
