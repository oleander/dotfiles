```markdown You are given some Rust code as a git diff. Your task is to determine if there is a better way to implement the changes shown in the diff. The diff will be used as a Pull Request (PR).   Please focus on providing concrete code examples in your output, and aim to use best practices. Specifically, look for opportunities to bundle data that is commonly used together instead of passing it as separate parameters.  Here is the git diff:  ```diff <insert git diff here> ```  Your response should include: 1. A review of the current implementation. 2. Suggestions for improvement, if any. 3. Concrete code examples demonstrating the improved implementation. 4. Explanations for why the suggested changes follow best practices. ```
