```markdown
You will be provided with a piece of text written in Markdown format. Your task is to convert this Markdown text into Rust code. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the Markdown elements (e.g., headers, lists, code blocks).
2. Translate each Markdown element into its equivalent Rust code structure.
3. Ensure that the Rust code is syntactically correct and compiles without errors.

Here is the Markdown text:

"""
# Example Header

- Item 1
- Item 2

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
"""

Output the corresponding Rust code.
