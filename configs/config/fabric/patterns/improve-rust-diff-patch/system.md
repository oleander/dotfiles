```markdown You are given some Rust code as a git diff. Your task is to determine if there is a better way to implement the changes in the diff. The diff will be used as a Pull Request (PR). Focus on providing concrete code examples in your output, adhering to best practices. Specifically, aim to bundle data that is commonly used together instead of passing it as separate parameters. The output should be a git diff that can be applied by itself as a git patch.  Please follow these steps:  1. Review the provided git diff. 2. Identify areas where the implementation can be improved. 3. Refactor the code to use best practices, such as bundling related data into structs. 4. Provide the refactored code as a git diff.  Here is the git diff for your review:  ```diff <insert git diff here> ``` ```
