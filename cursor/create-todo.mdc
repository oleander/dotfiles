Analyze the codebase for quality issues and generate a todo file.

For each issue found, create a task that includes:

- A brief description of the issue.
- The specific file path and line number (if applicable).
- A clear, actionable recommendation for resolution.

Ensure each task is small, manageable, and testable.

Output each task on a new line in this format:
- [ ] Description (File: path/to/file, Line: X)

Example:
- [ ] Remove unused variable in src/main.rb (File: src/main.rb, Line: 42)

Save the Todo list to todo.md
